      <p>Hi! My name is Phoebe and I am a Havanese puppy that was born on May 14, 2016. I have two great parents named Bob and Marilyn who take care of me every day.</br> I have a lot of energy during the day and I like to relax during the night. I am very smart and I've learned a lot of commands that my daddy taught me.</br> I can play fetch and I love tug of war with my parents. My mommy thinks I should be a wide receiver in football because I love to catch my toys in midair.</br>I love to lick everyone because I love them and they pet me.</br> I get so excited when my mommy and daddy come home because I miss them so much. My name is Phoebe and this is my website</p>
